# Jobunam
The research developed a web based ‘UNAM Job Portal’ for graduates to search for their
desired jobs and as well for recruiters to contact the right candidates for their vacancies. Job
seeking graduates from several backgrounds of studies can search for current job vacancies at
various organizations. They can also register and update their profile with their set skills and
details. Employers on the other hand can register with the web application and post their current
vacancies. They can also view the applicants and screen them to determine suitability as per
their organizational demands.
